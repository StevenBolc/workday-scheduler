I began the prject by assigning proper classes predesignated in the CSS to seperate groups in the html. 

once i was done properly segmenting the html, i started adding the javascript.

First, i added the time using the setInterval method. later i added a function that would grab from the html and compare it to the time. lastly i added a prevent default for the lock button and assigned proper variables so i could link them to the page using a localStorage setter method.
